# ðŸ‘‹Hi
This was a project I completed for university during the course `Programming in C` in **2019**.
The purpose was to use an `Arduino UNO` to develop a timed stepper motor activation script.

I used a DCF77 receiver and a stepper motor to implement the time functionality.

# ðŸ“” Usage
1. Launch the `Arduino IDE` and install the necessary libraries.
2. Attach a stepper motor and a DCF77 receiver.
3. Adjust the pins to your requirement.
